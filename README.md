# Rust for Blockchain Development

## 🚀 Introduction  
This repository documents my journey in learning [Rust](w) for blockchain development, specifically for blockchain. Rust's memory safety, performance, and concurrency make it an excellent choice for building secure and efficient blockchain applications.  

## 📌 Goals  
- Master Rust fundamentals (ownership, borrowing, lifetimes)  
- Understand cryptographic principles in blockchain  
- Explore Rust frameworks for blockchain ([Substrate](w), [Solana](w), etc.)  
- Build smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps)  
- Develop a secure and scalable blockchain system  

## 🛠️ Setup  
1. Install Rust using [rustup](w):  
   ```sh
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
